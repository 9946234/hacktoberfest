Minecraft... if you asked a 3-4 year old kid have they ever heard of Minecraft they would say, no but sounds like a rip-off of fortnite. Ask a 5-7 year old do they know what Minecraft is they would say, oh that game, yeah it died so fast. If you asked a 8-10 year old have you played Minecraft they would say, yeah that game was so easy. But if you asked a 11+ kid, do you remember Minecraft.... they would say with a tear coming down their eye, That name, brings back so many good memories. I remember my first time playing, it was when I was 7, I opened my play store and saw this game. I thought it would be bad but I played it and fell in love instantly. A game where there are no limits, no rules, and full of imagination. But as the years went by, it started to die, and fortnite arose from the ground. Minecraft then started to die slowly and slowly. But even if I dies and when it does, It will always have a place in my heart.ï»¿ These are the true children of the future, and they will hopefully live to see the world of their imaginations--crafted like the worlds that defined them.
